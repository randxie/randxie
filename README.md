ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @randxie, a data scientist turned machine learning system engineer, currently working on Large Language Model.

Previously, I led the ML platform team in Robinhood to build feature store, ML model training / serving / monitoring and generative AI infrastructure. I also spent 2.5 years in Google Cloud - Vertex AI doing similar things (built ML infrastructure products on Google cloud). In my free time, I enjoy building open-source software and participating in data science challenges ([Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/randxie)).

Before working on machine learning, I worked on machines. I hold a bachelor and master in mechanical engineering, and had spent 4 years in the field of predictive maintenance, including:

* Core developer of ML training and serving infrastructure for predictive maintenance in Uptake
* Core developer of [predictive maintenance toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/predictive-maintenance.html)
* Student researcher working on industry 4.0 in [the Center for Intelligent Maintenance System](http://www.imscenter.net/IMS)
